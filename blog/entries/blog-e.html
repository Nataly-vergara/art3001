    <p>Are we headed into the 6th ice age?</p>
    <p>This huge winter system sprinkled some snow over Alabama</p>
    <p>Schools cancled, stores closed, at the town froze seemingly more than the ice in our skies</p>
    <p>My suburb got a nice dusting Tuesday morning.</p>
    <p>The counties seemed to get more though</p>
    <p>Our small moutains looked dandruffty on their peaks</p>
    <p>The snow continued all day. It stopped stickicking, unable to compete with the dixie sunshine burning behind the snow clouds.</p>

    
    <p>I worried about our climate at the begining of covid</p>
    <p>I tried to switch, in a anxious frenzie, to being plastic free</p>
    <p>I actually enjoy bar shampoo</p>
    <p>I still bought two bottles of carole's beauty a few months later</p>
    <p>it just makes me think more</p>
    <p>i blame america's economic system of capitolism for motivations of profits over quality and morality.</p>
    <p>Even companies that advertise as eco friendly or eco concious are seemling still catering to profits and the advertisement ploy.</p>
    <p>I just, I feel so manipulated.</p>
    <p>like do i even like the brand of butter i eat.</p>
    <p>or like is it just because it's the butter my mom's always bought so i just think I like it.</p>
    <p>I have to admit that i am a big fastfood consuer</p>
    <p>like atleast but totally more than once a week I eat out</p>
    <p>UGH</p>
    <p>and like i always use so many napkins</p>
    <p>I hate having sticky hands</p>
    <p>so i wash my hands alot</p>
    <p>and take long showers</p>
    <p>like really long showers</p>
    <p>so yeah i am a mess</p>
    <p>i am wasteful</p>
    <p>I am trying to be intentional</p>
    <p>intentional with where i leave things</p>
    <p>intentional with what i wear</p>
    <p>intentional with how i think</p>
    <p><h4>INTENTIONAL</h4></p>
