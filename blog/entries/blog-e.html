    <p>Are we headed into the 6th ice age?</p>
    <p>This huge winter system sprinkled some snow over Alabama</p>
    <p>Schools cancled, stores closed, at the town froze seemingly more than the ice in our skies</p>
    <p>My suburb got a nice dusting Tuesday morning.</p>
    <p>The counties seemed to get more though</p>
    <p>Our small moutains looked dandruffty on their peaks</p>
    <p>The snow continued all day but stopped stickicking, unable to compete with the dixie sunshine burning behind the snow clouds.</p>

    
    <p>I worried about our climate the begining of covid</p>
    <p>I tried to switch over in a anxious frenzie to being plastic free</p>
    <p>I actually enjoy bar shampoo</p>
