        <p>SUP</p>
        <p>So update on my work situation.</p>
        <p>The kids I wake up are the best part of my day</p>
        <p>Its just easy.</p>
        <p>Despite 6:45am seeming ealier each morning</p>
        <p>When I get there</p>
        <p>I wash a few dishes.</p>
        <p>Feed their dogs</p>
        <p>make breakfast</p>
        <p>wake them up at 7:15</p>
        <p>The two kids are not grumpy</p>
        <p>kinda reserved due to moring grodg</p>
        <p>I personally have bad internal timming with standard times so I've had to rush them out the door a few times.</p>
        <p>Its usally a smooth morning.</p>
        <p>I feel like either neutrual or benfited from our synegy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>SO</p>
        <p>They're living with just their dad (divorced parents)</p>
        <p>So He just started dating.</p>
        <p>I two weeks ago became his 'girl friends' babysitter for her two year old </p>
        <p>Its 3 hours every night M-F</p>
        <p>She constantly will be asking for her mom</p>
        <p>Its hard to redirect her mind when shes doing something like eating</p>
        <p>I dont know the whole situation, but my baby has a long day of day care at 9am and than me until 9pm</p>
        <p>We've been having bath-time.</p>
        <p>At first it would be continues sobs the entire bath</p>
        <p>Two weeks in she finally adjusting.</p>
        <p>Although she HATES having her hair washed</p>
        <p>My co-worker at the Toy Store I also work at told me about sensory problems her daughter has, making bath-time especially difficult.</p>
        <p>Im suspucious of this, because she dislikes being barefoot. Although her mother has not insuiated to me that she dislikes bathtimes by her mom.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">do you have &quot;avoid socks At All Costs&quot; sensory issues or do you have &quot;must wear socks At All Times&quot; sensory issues</p>&mdash; lazy perfectionist (@kazADHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/kazADHD/status/1372935094525173760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>I'm also struggling with getting her to eat much of anything for dinner</p>
        <p>She'll eat:</p>
        <ol>ham</ol>
        <ol>bananas</ol>
        <ol>goldfish</ol>
        <ol>cheese</ol>
        <ol>fruit snacks</ol>
        <ol>blended fruit/veggie pouches</ol>
        <p>She would not eat:</p>
        <ol>taco seasoned ground beef</ol>
        <ol>scrambelled eggs</ol>
        <ol>spagetti squash </ol>
        <ol>sweet potatoe</ol>
        <p>I noticed shes a slow slow slow eater and likes to save her meat for last</p>
        <p>When she really likes the food she shovels it in our mouth</p>
        <p>holds as much as she can in her chubby cheeks</p>
        <p>and will chew and chat.</p>
        <p>She sometimes says sentences very clearly</p>
        <p>No is her favorite word. But she doesn't entirely use it correctly at all</p>
        <p>Ex. Do you want more? response: NO</p>
        <p>Moments later shes whinning when I go to clean up her plate</p>
        <p>She goes eehh-ehh-eh!! when ever she wants something</p>
        <p>Im starting to find it incredibly annoying</p>
        <p>So she learning to say please</p>
        <p>shes a terrible sharer and grabs things out of my hands.</p>
        <p>I honeslty - I don't know if I like it</p>
        <p>Ealier this week I was thinking about quitting </p>
        <p>School fills most of my spare moments</p>
        <p>Ill stay up after she leaves and shower and watch some TV to unwind</p>
        <p>I just need to do some maintence in my enviroment so I'm hoping the academic break will catch me up.</p>
        <p>I have <a href="blog-j.html">more</a> to say about my situation</p>
