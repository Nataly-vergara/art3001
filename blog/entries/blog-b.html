    <p> <h2>Response to: What do screens want?</h2></p>
    <p> January 31, 2021</p>
    <p>I found Frank Chimeo’s talk adaptation, “What Screens Want,” intriguing analysis of a user’s interaction with software and technology eye opening. It discussed that with out software as a padding, computers would not be used as widely as they are. Built into software, interfaces guid users' experiences. Interfaces clearly indicate abstract processes of the software with familiar metaphors. Visual images and designed interfaces have democratized tech so the average person can utilize software  and technology. Unfortunately over time, this designation creates users that are passive. This perpetuates an unhealthy relationship with technology that has already developed in today’s youth. A psychologist coined the term ‘screenagers' to describe the mass teen’s addiction to their smartphones. These kids are not hooked on their phones making and creating new media. No, they are on media, consuming media. Popular media platforms are programmed now based on user interaction to keep users attention. Young minds are succumbing to manipulation of algorithms. Simply put the passive use of software leaves users vulnerable to manipulation of corporations. Chimeo simply puts that “technology feels like something that happens to you instead of something you use.” The web how it's currently used is a space of commodity, geeked towards profit off your attention not the technologies usefulness. In his closing he points out that “what screens what needs to match up with what we want.” Technology is ours we are not puppets of it. We should not be “doing it for the vine” but the vine should do it for us. In conclusion, I want the internet to stop hurting us and making us less productive. We as users need to become proactive and stop to question the implications of our active attention to these passive applications of software. This is my prayer. Amen

    <p>During our class conversation of skuedomorphing related to this same talk, we discussed the experience gaps of older generations. Many people pointed out that their grandparents continue to use flip phones because of the familiarity. Where as someone else mentioned that older family members were loyal to apple products, because of their user friendly capabilities. Apple has developed software that’s like the padding in an aspiring pill. They slowly started to transfer things literally into their software, like camera note and candlers, until they could start to rapidly change them with confidence in mind. Apple plays on adaptability and the keen-ness of its users. Perhaps when older generations choose to remove themselves from the tech revolution they are simply not adapting like the rest of us. There’s an ageism involved with technology, it seems to discriminate against the old. Tech is so fast moving that it’s similar to pop culture. It’s hard for adults to keep up with pop-culture as it is made and upheld by the youth. There must come an age when the world . In today's rapidly changing world, adaptability is our strongest weapon. </p>
