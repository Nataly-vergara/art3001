    <p>Humans are literally so random. </p>
    <p>As a whole group we constantly have this 3-D array of choices we can make.
        People make good and bad decisions but not even that.
        It seems our pendulum between good and bad swings even against the reality of gravity.
        When I was little I always used to think about my swing going all the way around.
        Humans seem to still do things so ridiculously, it seems removed from the general sense of gravity. 
        </p>
        <p>We really do push limits. </p>
        <p>In the grand scheme of humanity, the swing is the general conception of morality. </p>
        <p>It’s simply there because we think about it.</p>
        <p>But humanity still finds places so absurd it seems our pendulum is on its head.  </p>
        <p>Polar good- like miracles </p>
        <p>Polar evil- curses, devils, demons, literal psycopaths</p>
        <p>This pairs with my theory. 
        </p>
        <p>This theory that God will finally end the world when every possible decision has been made. </p>
        <p>Once our pendulum has gone everywhere it can, then it will be done. 
        </p>
        <p>Once the energy of letting there be light has finally and fully been exerted, it will just stop.</p>
        <p>But, back to randomness. Probability is defined as an overarching pattern to seemingly random processes overtime. </p>
        <p>Life seems random, but if we wanted to calculate it all in all its factors and glory, it all pretty much would end up defined under some process. 
        </p>
        <p>Maybe on day AI will be able to mimic this. </p>
        <p>But AI will never be able to mimic humanity’s fickleness.</p>
        <p>My grasp is AI will never be a surprise, to me it’s coded to know how to code what it learns.  
        </p>
        <p>But can you learn randomness, defining probability still does not make a100% accurate prediction.</p>
        <p>It’s the minute-detail of our lives. The small decision to sigh, or to flash a smile that is random and possibly can be predicted with some huge measure of our randomness, but that inturn will never produce the same organic quality of life as we know it. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>This would be all pretty inaccurate if I were to assume life is a simulation.</p>
        <p>Am I real, or you real. Are we simply such a powerful and simulating code that we appear real and are able to feel. Will we even realize once we end up in another simulating code that we as the code will eventually recreate in a loophole of existence?
