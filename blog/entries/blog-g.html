    <p><h3>an extended summary of my relationship with my boyfriend the past two years</h3></p>
    <article>
        <p>My boyfriend and I are technically highschool sweethearts. Well he’s my highschool sweetheart.</p>
        <p>He graduated May 2019.        </p>
        <p>The week before his graduation a friend suggested that Jackson and I might get along.
        </p>
        <p>He had hung out with my friends and I a weekend back in november of 2018 and besides knowing that he had dated a girl in the grade above himself, I didn’t know much else about him.
        </p>
        <p>We shared a few words over snapchat.</p>
        <p>I confirmed he was single.</p>
        <p>At his graduation I spotted him from across the foyer of our theater building.</p>
        <p>He flashed me</p>
        <p>A <b>BIG</b> huge smile.</p>
        <p>It had this overwhelming effect on me.</p>
        <p>It felt like fear.</p>
        <p>I think my recovering depressed brain cross signals. </p>
        <p>Our first time hanging out, we ended up making out in the back of his friend’s pick-up in the middle of the drive-thru theater in the summer countryside of our sticky alabama summer. 
        </p>
        <p>We spent nearly every other day together that summer.
        </p>
        <p>Between both of our work schedules, we spent many late nights together.</p>
        <p>We went to the pool.</p>
        <p>We would go eat.</p>
        <p>Go to the movies.</p>
        <p>My friend and I would be invited over to nights of him drinking with his <i>boys</i>. </p>
        <p>He even let me meet his parents.</p>
        <p>His mom saw me and announce that I was super cute.</p>
        <p>She’s an artist as well and we spent our dinner exchanging our artwork and ideas.</p>
        <p>Afterwards we say Toy Story 4.</p>
        <p>As the summer came to a close, my poor little heart didn’t want us to end just because of his inevitable departure for school.</p>
        <p>Three hours away he would be starting his freshman year at The University of Mississippi or Ole miss for short. (Hotty Toddy)</p>
        <p>We preserved. </p>
        <p>We facetimed a good bit.</p>
        <p>He’d call me while he made himself tuna sandwiches or microwaved a dorm room meal.
        </p>
        <p>Occasionally on his way back from classes, we chat during my lunch period.
        </p>
        <p>He was very generous to my tender heart and would come over almost every two weeks.</p>
        <p>We would spend a day and an evening together.</p>
        <p>We’d watch tv, or go hammock at haze nature preserve.</p>
        <p>We’d go to the movies and dinner or stay in and watch a movie.</p>
        <p>He taught me how to play call of duty against bots.</p>
        <p>We were always working on my aiming capabilities.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>My brain quick to pull the trigger but not calm enough to also aim down my sights.</p>
