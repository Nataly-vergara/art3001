    <h1>Treatise to Comfort</h1>
</header>
<body>
   <p> I am really interested in creating an open artwork on the web in conversation with my collage.</p>
   <p> I feel torn about it, because I would still like to curate the added images so it still would be my piece and not become junky.</p> 
   <p>I guess I would mediate it?</p>
   <p>I think I'll ask my peers to submit photos to it and maybe have it routed to a separate page of submitted images and then I could edit and add them myself</p>
   <p>My art history class inspired this</p>
   <p>Our lecture was one a reliquary statue for St. Foy in Conque, France</p>
   <p>in the 1st-3rd century people would leave offerings like rings and gemstones to the statue</p>
   <p>The church would sell- for fund- or add them to the statue</p>
   <p>It created this composite work that is very strange and unique but so beautiful in the way that it was culminated by the care and worship of others.</p>
   <p>Now I dont want my website to become an Idol.</p>
   <p>But wouldn't that be nice?</p>
   <p>I feel like the swarms of people infront of the mona lisa and starry night nearly idolize it.</p>
   <p>Poplar works are so blindly praised by the masses that they don't even question why they must take a photo or travel to see it, only that its this "famous" work.</p>
   <p>Swarms of people on a certain site can make it crash.</p>
   <p>This translates to me how my fascination with the celebrated artist has crashed.</p>
   <p>I no longer want to spend time with picasso and claude monet.</p>
   <p>They're so superficially absorbed by people, that the recognitio almost ruins their facination with me.</p>
   <p>Perhaps even my cuerration style or collaging is too recognizable to me and I need to become more subjective again in order to discover newer techniques.</p>
   <p>Mastery seems to inhibit development.</p>
   <p>My boyfriend's mother, is a great painter</p>
   <p>She never went to school or anything for art, but has developed her own techniques for painting with oil's that she basically glaze's the canvas so she maintains a light airness to her paintings of the white canvas space beneath </p>
   <p>This is problematic, as she comfortable in this style she has mastered it limits her from exploring other techniques</p>
   <p>We develope comfort zone's with out even consciously realizing it.</p>
   <p>Perhaps it's a habit of drinking a glass of wine every night to "unwind"</p>
   <p>maybe it a haphazard style of driving</p>
