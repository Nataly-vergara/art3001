    <p>
        He missed my senior homecoming dance because of initiation for his pledging frat.
    </p>
    <p>I remember sometimes at the end of the weekend I would have him hug me while I cried asking him not to go back.
    </p>
    <p>I was immature and suffered from acute attachment issues as a result of a previous relationship. </p>
    <p>It would make me turn sour.</p>
    <p>I would bitch to him alot.</p>
    <p>I had an abusive relationship with my closest friend.
    </p>
    <p>I was struggling with my ongoing depression.</p>
    <p>I felt as though he was leaving me.</p>
    <p>I subconsciously blamed him for leaving me.
    </p>
    <p>For us not being able to connect and grow more as he was always so far.
    </p>
    <p>He recently told me this first year “sucked ass”.</p>
    <p>There were good time too.</p>
    <p>He courted me to dinner and furniture window shopping on our first valentines day, and gave me lovely dozen roses. (I still even have one sitting drying in a coke bottle vase in my room)</p>
    <p>But there were also really bad times like when he missed the winter dance “hoopcoming”.</p>
    <p>I called him afterwards sobbing and yelling about being mistreated and alone and how I never had a date for a highschool dance.
    </p>
    <p>He promised prom. </p>
    <p>I know one night I made him so mad he punched his minifridge. </p>
    <p>I think it was that night.</p>
    <p>When covid hit that spring, I was actually kinda relieved about it.</p>
    <p>It meant he would be home, right down the street from me.
    </p>
    <p>We hung out every day.</p>
