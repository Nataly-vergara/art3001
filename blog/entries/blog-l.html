    <h1>Treatise of Comfort (cont'd)</h1>
</header>
<body>
    <p>maybe it's a family tradition that every year you have to make cookies on christmas eve</p>
   <p>But is it really a style or tradition if you're not willing to explore and question?</p>
   <p>You don't necessarily need to ditch it or even reject it entirely. </p>
   <p>continue to draw your cartoons, or character you've been obsessed with drawing.</p>
   <p>But there needs to be a point at which you question it.</p>
   <p>Does the tradition actually improve my state of mind or environment?</p>
   <p>Will this make a good, neutral or negative impact on me and others around me.</p>
   <p>I guess it's like dont get tunnel vision.</p>
   <p>Don't aim for one goal, because the world is chaotic and in constant motion and you're goal can exist one day and be completely muet the next</p>
   <p>What I'm getting at is keeping your mind and habits adaptable.</p>
   <p>As someone with ADHD I do not like to adhere to a routine. It just doesnt vibe with my psyche</p>
   <p>I could never set aside a certain day to do laundry or even a specific time to take medicine.</p>
   <p>Now I do enjoy structure, I like having classes and knowing a general agenda. I love to plan.</p>
   <p>Even if I dont stick to the plan.</p>
   <p>You have to pay attention.</p>
   <p>You have to be introspective- retrospective- reflective- proactive</p>
   <p>what ever you want to call it.</p>
   <p>observe your self</p>
   <p>observe the world around you</p>
   <p>how can you be more adaptable, more response</p>
   <p>less compulsive</p>
   <p>How can you interact with your world in a productive and contemporary manner.</p>
   <p>If people would question standards and traditions and actively do something about it, maybe we will finally be able to evolve from our subconscious restrively reactive primal states.

<p>An Aside:</p>
<p>I also have dyslexia. And thank you to Noah Webster for standardizing the english language and spelling, my reliance on phonetic spelling is a technique of adaptable spelling, I would say, is set muet and constantly scrutinized for lack of communication. It's already difficult for me to express myself verbally and add the hoop of "recognizable" standardized spelling and you could say I'm spellbound. I have been told that I apparently attempts to express my complex ideas but because of my poor grammar and spelling am never rewarded for my responsiveness. The limitations of traditions are profoundly limiting to those of non "neurotypical" minds.</p>
<p>The world has becomed so geared towards doing things the "right way"</p>
<p>But is the "right way" even correct of just.</p>
<p>Society must become more adaptable and inclusive if we want to continue forward in any progressional matter.</p>
