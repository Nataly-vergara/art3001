    <header><h1>UGH</h1></header>
    <article>
        <p>I’m tired.</p>
        <p>I really try hard not to procrastinate.</p>
        <p>But I started. Again. Grrr. </p>
        <p>I have been doing things the day they’re due this past week.
        </p>
        <p>I just want to not be having class and just doing homework constantly.
        </p>
        <p>Which it really feels like constantly.</p>
        <p>I feel I'm simply doing things to get them done.</p>
        <p>I honestly like school.</p>
        <p>I like the structure.</p>
        <p>I like obsessing about it.</p>
        <p>I love the sheduleing.</p>
        <p>And the “productivity’.</p>
        <p>I like getting things done, it’s satisfying.</p>
        <p>I love learning.</p>
        <p>It just doesn’t interest me right now.</p>
        <p>I hate being unmotivated. </p>
        <p>I feel distanced and yet this is all my involvement. So. it’s kinda ;/
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I started a new job, babysitting.</p>
        <p>Their dad goes to work at 6:45am and I wake the kids at 7:15am.
        </p>
        <p>I wake up at 6am and shower, get dressed, brush my hair and teeth, take my meds, grab some water and then drive over to their house by 6:45am.
        </p>
        <p>It’s still dusk when I walk in.</p>
        <p>Sometimes he has earlier morning meetings and I am to be there by 6am.</p>
        <p>This week 6am came a whole lot earlier then I was ready for.
        </p>
        <p>I pet their coffee pitcher, deprived of it’s vitality. I got caught helplessly gawking at their fantastic coffee maker. (i’ve never had coffee in my house) 
        </p>
        <p>I still feel a bit frozen there in the early morning grog. </p>
        <br>
        <p>So also, my boyfriend has a crazy obsessive and productive mom. She doesn’t work anymore but like idk why but when she gets into something she completely dives in. I get it yk, but like. I find it a bit obnoxious, when I liked astrology to help bring some dopamine into my life to cure my depression and when I brought up that I kinda liked it she completely busted my balls. So apparently bc the universe is expanding it completely nullifies astrology from the 1800’s which is what it’s based it. But like, I just think it’s on of those probability things. I think it’s a way of defining the chaos yk. </p>
        <p>Theres a quote, that “pay attention to everything and the truth will reveal itself” So who’s to stay that if we study the starts and our alignment we can’t find some truth. 
        </p>
        <p>I think being apart of astrologers meme’s on social media helped keep me alive there for a second.</p>
        <p>So like f*ck her, (i mean not really she doesn’t even know about all of my sh*t around it)</p>
        <p>Anyways his crazy obsessive mom is writing a book, so she’s in tennessee in a rental house writing her book. Which i will never read by the way, it’s so like 1800’s western romance like I don’t even know.</p>
        <p>So him and his dad went up there this weekend,,, so no valentines day for me.
        </p>
        <p>I didn’t have any expectations for the day so maybe that's why i'm not gonna have anything. 
            Im only a little sad, but i never had a date for any highschool dances so its like ive gone numb to these things. 
            </p>
            <p style="color: crimson;"> <b>Happy Valentines day! </b></p>
