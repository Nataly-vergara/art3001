    <p>Is this what power feels like?</p>
    <p>My pages load! It all begins with as simple text:This is my first cool website. 
        Only a few hours into my ~internet art~ course endowes a new technique of creation.
        Creation!  
        Creation at my figure tips.
        I AM GOD here.
        I may not be infinite, but this is now my space.
        Its nice to mark a spot.
        I couldn't ask to be well traversed, but I do have an ownership now atleast.
        I always felt so restricted by the internet before coding. So restrained to mainstream site like google and social media platform.
        It so impersonal, I can put my name places, make memberships, pretend, rent my spot. But now I am a spot. People can now join me and follow me, become a member to the cult that is me. 
        But is this website about world domination, maybe eventually but that's besides the point. 
        I have a space on the internet. A blank infinite page, space I can put anything on. 
        I exist now in the digital space. This is my voice. Can you hear me yet. Hello. Anyone out there listening to my words?
