    <p>Is this what power feels like?</p>
    <p>My pages loaded!</p>
    <p> It all begins with as simple text:This is my first cool website. 
    </p>
    <p>Only a few hours into my <a href="">~internet art~</a> course endowes a new technique of creation.</p>
        <p>Creation!</p>  
        <p>Creation at my figure tips.</p>
        <p>I AM GOD here.</p>
        <p>I may not be infinite, but this is now my space.</p>
        <p>I have my own spot.</p> 
        <p>I couldn't ask to be well traversed, but I do have an ownership now atleast.
        I always felt so restricted by the internet before coding. So restrained to mainstream site like google and social media platform.
        The restraints of the site let you leave your name places by making memberships. You pretend, you rent a "spot". </p> 
        <p>But here, I am a spot.</p>
        <p>People can now join me and follow me, become a member to the cult that is ME. </p>
        <p> But is this website for world domination? </p> 
           <p> ...maybe eventually but that's besides the point. </p>
        <p>I have my own blank infinite page of pixels. Edge to edge of your window, is now mine.</p> 
       <p> A blank infinite page, space I can put anything on. </p>
        <p>I exist now in the digital space. This is my voice. Can you hear me yet. Hello. Anyone out there listening to my words?</p>

       <p> Hey you over there? Wanna hang out with me? </p>
        <p>Besides my god complex, I can be a pretty intresting person.</p>

        <p>Oh can I add a live chat room to my page that would be amazing to just talk to people as the visit the site or even let it be a project.</p>
